This blog aims to share my thoughts about software engineering in general so that I can put them in perspective and reflect on
them. So don't look for fitting your ideas to what I present here, neither create expectations on what you think compared to what
I put here. My idea is just to clarify my own thoughts about tough situations and process involving software development.

Nevertheless, you're welcome to share your thoughts as well and take advantages from what I share here, if you will.

Writing is harder than thinking, but better than simply thinking. Writing demands cohesion, structure, putting your logic in words, and
thus needs efforts to organize the ruthless and uncontrolled flow of our thoughts.

It's grateful when I can put in words those thoughts which I could find trivial structuring them in words.

Welcome to the world of engineering things which are brute!
