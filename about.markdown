Brain in a jar is a blog where I can share my thoughts about my software development experience in general. 
I play with the word 'jar' because it can mean two things depending on which context it is used. In philosophy 'jar' is 
used with its plain meaning but in a very specific thought experiment about the reality of our perpectual experiences. 
On other hand, 'jar' in software development means the executable artefact generated in Java to be run upon JVM
